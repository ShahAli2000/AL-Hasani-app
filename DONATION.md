# Donations / Support Book Production

This page explains what the optional "Support now" donation in the AL-Hasani app is for.

## What this donation supports

The donation is intended to help fund the physical production of updated printed editions of the AL-Hasani collection (for example: final editing, layout/typesetting, printing, and distribution costs).

## What this donation does NOT do

- It does not unlock features inside the app.
- It does not provide any digital content, subscription, or in-app service.
- The app remains fully usable without donating.

## How funds are used

Funds are applied to expenses directly related to producing the next printed edition(s), such as:

- printing and binding
- design and layout
- proofreading and preparation
- shipping and distribution
- other production-related costs

## Updates and transparency

We will publish progress updates (milestones, printing status, and general cost breakdowns when possible) in this repository.

## Questions

If you have questions about the donation, please contact the team through the app's Feedback section.
